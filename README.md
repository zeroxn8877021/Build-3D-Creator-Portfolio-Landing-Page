# 3D Creator Portfolio Landing Page

A fully custom, animation-driven portfolio landing page built for a 3D creator brand ("Jack"). The project was engineered from a precise design specification, with pixel-accurate execution across every breakpoint and zero reliance on pre-built animation templates.

## Demo

A full scroll-through video walkthrough of the live build is included in the `Assets` folder (`jackportofplio.mp4`).

## Tech Stack

- React 18.3.1
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- Framer Motion 12.38.0
- Lucide React 0.344.0
- Vite

## Overview

The page is composed of five fully custom sections, each built around a shared set of reusable, hand-engineered components rather than off-the-shelf animation libraries or UI kits.

### 1. Hero Section

Full-viewport hero with a horizontal navbar (About, Price, Projects, Contact), a massive gradient headline scaling fluidly from 14vw to 17.5vw across breakpoints, and a bottom bar pairing descriptive copy with a gradient Contact button. The hero portrait is wrapped in a custom-built Magnet component that produces a mouse-following magnetic hover effect. All elements enter with staggered fade-in animations timed across the section.

### 2. Marquee Section

Two rows of tripled image assets (21 total sources) that scroll horizontally in opposite directions based on real-time page scroll position. Offset is calculated from live scroll data using a passive scroll listener, with `willChange: transform` applied for rendering performance.

### 3. About Section

A centered, full-height section featuring four independently animated decorative elements positioned across the viewport corners, a large gradient heading, and a character-by-character scroll-driven text reveal where each character's opacity is tied directly to scroll progress.

### 4. Services Section

A white-background section listing five core services (3D Modeling, Rendering, Motion Design, Branding, Web Design) in a numbered vertical layout, with border-separated rows and staggered fade-in reveals per item.

### 5. Projects Section

Three sticky-stacking project cards built using Framer Motion's `useScroll` and `useTransform` hooks, producing a progressive scale-down stacking effect as the user scrolls through each card. Each card uses an asymmetric two-column image grid layout.

## Reusable Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `ContactButton` | Gradient pill button used for primary calls to action |
| `LiveProjectButton` | Ghost/outline pill button used for project links |
| `FadeIn` | Scroll-triggered entrance animation wrapper with configurable delay, duration, and axis offset |
| `Magnet` | Mouse-tracking magnetic hover effect for interactive elements |
| `AnimatedText` | Character-by-character scroll-reveal text animation |

## Engineering Notes

- Fully mobile-first architecture, scaling cleanly from small screens to ultra-wide displays.
- All typography built on `clamp()` for fluid scaling rather than fixed breakpoint overrides.
- Every motion sequence — fade-ins, magnetic effects, scroll-linked transforms, and character reveals — was built directly on Framer Motion primitives, with no third-party animation presets.
- Consistent easing curves and transition timing maintained across all five sections for a unified motion language.

## Full Design Specification

The section below is the original technical specification the project was built against, included here for reference and reproducibility.

Heading: "Project" (singular) using .hero-heading gradient, same styling as other headings.
3 sticky-stacking project cards that scale down as you scroll past them (card stacking effect using Framer Motion useScroll and useTransform). Each card is sticky top-24 md:top-32 inside an h-[85vh] container. Scale calculation: targetScale = 1 - (totalCards - 1 - index) * 0.03. Each card offset by top: ${index * 28}px.

Bottom row: Two-column image grid -- left column (40% width) has 2 stacked images, right column (60%) has 1 tall image. All images have heavy border radius rounded-[40px] sm:rounded-[50px] md:rounded-[60px]. Left top image height: clamp(130px, 16vw, 230px). Left bottom image height: clamp(160px, 22vw, 340px).

FadeIn: Framer Motion wrapper using whileInView with viewport={{ once: true, margin: "50px", amount: 0 }}. Accepts delay, duration (default 0.7), x (default 0), y (default 30). Easing: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1]. Uses motion.create() for dynamic element types.
Magnet: Mouse-following magnetic hover effect. Tracks mouse position relative to element center, applies translate3d transform divided by strength factor. Activates when cursor is within padding distance of element edge. Smooth transition in (0.3s ease-out) and out (0.6s ease-in-out). Uses willChange: 'transform'.
AnimatedText: Character-by-character scroll-reveal text animation. Each character goes from opacity 0.2 to 1 based on its position in the text relative to scroll progress. Uses Framer Motion useScroll targeting the paragraph element with offset ['start 0.8', 'end 0.2']. Each character uses invisible placeholder + absolute positioned animated span.

KEY DEPENDENCIES
react, react-dom (^18.3.1), framer-motion (^12.38.0), lucide-react (^0.344.0), tailwindcss (^3.4.1), vite, typescript

RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS
All sections use Tailwind's default breakpoints (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px) with mobile-first approach. Heavy use of clamp() for fluid typography. The entire design scales gracefully from mobile to ultra-wide screens.
